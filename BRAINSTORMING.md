Brainstorming - Your 3 ideas. Put your name at the head! Each group member should record at least three new app ideas, including a brief description of each idea. 

# Rowan W Osmon
1 - Stable diffusion api - Text to image generation -> Take users text input and generate AI images -> combine with speech to text?
2 - Google cloud - Speech to text api -> uses microphone as input and outputs text from the user -> combine with translation api for speech to alternate language text?
3 - MediaWiki api - Access/edit wikiâ€™s -> mobile app for rare wikis Ex: 1d4-chan tactics pages https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000/10th_Edition_Tactics

### Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
Great! You've got so many ideas, so now let's figure out which one is the winner.
Step 2a: Choose the top three
As a group, vote to determine your top three new app ideas. Pick things that seem interesting and fun to build!

- AI Flashcards
- AI tier list
- AI Shopping


## Step 2b: Evaluate ideas
It's important to not choose ideas based only on subjective opinions. To help with decision making, it's important to evaluate ideas against a framework, or a set of criteria.
We'll use the following framework to evaluate app ideas:
APP EVALUATION CRITERIA


Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
What makes your app more than a glorified website? |
--- | --- | ---
AI Flashcards | Able to swipe through cards, shuffle, and manage content on card.
AI Tier List | Dynamically generates items based on user input and arranges them throughout list.
AI Shopping Comparison | Allows the user to browse through item catalogs and manage shopping cart.

Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
Does an average user just consume your app, or do they use it to create something?
Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the deadline?
Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
 Close Section
